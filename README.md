# evcc Native App

Native app wrapper for evcc UI based on [react-native](https://reactnative.dev/) and [expo.dev](https://expo.dev/).

This is just a thin wrapper around the web UI. It contains an onboarding flow to configure the server URL.

## Development

```bash
npm install
```

Follow the expo instructions to run local simulators for [iOS](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/) and [Android](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/).

Start dev mode to get into an interactive development environment.

```bash
npm run start
```

Or start iOS, Android or Web simulator directly.

```bash
npm run ios
npm run android
npm run web
```
